# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Default Linux service installations to a private systemd runtime workspace
  at `%t/harness-gateway/work`, cleaned on stop, restart, and crash recovery.
  Preserve explicit service directories and the foreground current-directory
  default. Validate both service modes through real systemd lifecycle tests.

## v0.1.8 - 2026-11-07

- Add opt-in Linux systemd user-service install/uninstall commands, dry-run unit
  generation, explicit executable/PATH and working-directory configuration, JSON
  journal logging, bounded restart, and graceful cgroup cleanup. Protect foreign
  units and preserve user drop-ins; enablement and lingering remain explicit.
- Exercise real service start, stop, restart, crash recovery, buffered/SSE
  requests, and CLI cleanup in an isolated GitHub Actions user account.
- Reject missing Bash installer option values before creating directories,
  invoking Go, or modifying Bash settings; retain explicit paths to directories
  whose names start with a dash.
- Preserve stdout diagnostics from failed public-release verification commands
  while retaining their original exit status.
- Add public Go/Bash release verification with checksum and tag provenance,
  identical-binary checks, fixture HTTP smoke tests, and a Linux/macOS release
  workflow that also runs Spring AI acceptance against the installed artifact.
- Extend live Spring AI acceptance with blocking and streaming requests using
  discovered native model IDs, explicit selection, and response-model assertions.

## v0.1.7 - 2026-11-07

- Add concurrent HTTP model-discovery shutdown regressions and real-time catalog
  expiry, failed-refresh, and concurrent-recovery checks for both harnesses.
- Apply browser origin protection to model discovery GET/HEAD requests, including
  cached catalogs, while retaining same-origin Scalar and headerless CLI clients.
- Cache successful model catalogs for 30 seconds and share one bounded refresh
  across concurrent callers. Preserve independent cancellation, stop abandoned
  refreshes, and retain global CLI concurrency limits on cache misses.
- Exercise discovery expiry, cancellation, failures, abnormal worker exits,
  concurrent Java HTTP clients, and cold/warm browser-origin protection.
- Publish descendant-test PID markers atomically so cancellation cannot expose
  partially written PID data.
- Isolate Copilot request state in private temporary directories and disable the
  shared session store; remove state after stopping the CLI, including cancellation,
  crashes, failed session creation, and cleanup failures.
- Exercise persisted fixture state across failure paths and real installed Copilot
  storage isolation using an offline local mock provider without account credentials.
- Add a separate daily/manual compatibility canary for current public Codex/Copilot
  releases on Linux, macOS, and Windows, retaining resolved versions and test logs.
- Probe Copilot versions with `--no-auto-update`, matching the bundled runtime
  used for requests instead of reporting a newer cached runtime.

## v0.1.6 - 2026-11-06

- Retire Copilot SDK session event consumers before deleting completed sessions;
  bound detach cleanup and preserve compatibility with CLIs lacking that method.
- Expand the local Spring AI contract suite with deterministic request forwarding,
  model/reasoning overrides, response metadata, memory isolation, client timeouts,
  retry counts, and validation of unsupported options and wire features.
- Add opt-in Linux Spring AI soak testing with retained CSV samples for gateway
  RSS, post-GC heap/objects, goroutines, descriptors, and CLI process cleanup.
- Retain gateway diagnostics on failed/interrupted acceptance runs and add
  `--output-dir` for per-run logs; upload Spring AI reports, gateway logs, and soak
  CSV traces as CI artifacts.
- Add bounded Go fuzzing for Copilot framing and bridge authentication, with
  discovered regression inputs retained in CI.
- Test pinned real Codex/Copilot npm packages on Linux, macOS, and Windows without
  credentials or inference; keep installed-version assertions aligned with pins.
- Stabilize live Spring AI prompts and accept native final-only streaming while
  controlled fixtures retain incremental-delivery checks.
- Report early gateway exit status and launcher test deadlines clearly, and
  repeat Windows launcher integration checks in CI.

## v0.1.5 - 2026-11-06

- Accept an existing gateway executable in the Spring AI acceptance runner with `--gateway-binary`; run CI acceptance against a private Go-installed binary.
- Test versioned Go installation outside the checkout on Linux, macOS, and Windows, independently of the Unix Bash installer.
- Bound CI jobs and cancel superseded branch/PR runs without cancelling immutable tag runs.
- Support Windows `.cmd`/`.bat` CLI entry points through the shared owned-process launcher, and use Node.js consistently for `.js` entry points and version probes.
- Exercise Codex/Copilot protocol and lifecycle tests through native Windows batch shims, including paths with spaces, Unicode, and shell metacharacters.
- Add opt-in real-package version/protocol smoke tests and a credential-free Windows CI job with pinned Codex/Copilot npm packages.

## v0.1.4 - 2026-11-06

- Stop SSE output after a transport failure without renewing the write deadline for an error frame.
- Confirm process-group disappearance before suppressing macOS's transient zombie-group permission error during cleanup.
- Require Go 1.27.3 or newer and check reachable Go vulnerabilities in CI.
- Reject non-loopback Host headers and cross-origin browser completion requests;
  preserve unauthenticated curl, Spring AI, and same-origin Scalar clients.
- Preserve request timeout and cancellation causes when a CLI returns a transport
  error, including Codex blocked on stdin writes.
- Allow JSON-escaped Codex frames within the 16 MiB decoded assistant-text limit
  while keeping a bounded wire-frame size; deduplicate repeated final messages.
- Return sanitized HTTP 400 errors for explicit structured completion-parameter
  rejections, preserving generic CLI failures as HTTP 502.
- Warn when an earlier PATH entry shadows the binary installed by setup.sh.
- Share process-tree ownership across harnesses and CLI version probes, stopping
  descendants through Unix process groups and Windows Job Objects.
- Detect Codex parent exit promptly while draining buffered output, including
  crashes where a child retains stdout; preserve partial SSE text before errors.
- Guard Copilot frame and header sizes before SDK parsing through a private,
  token-authenticated loopback bridge; retain the official SDK for operations.
- Consume bridge credentials before the CLI handshake for installed-version
  compatibility, and use fixed copy buffers to avoid retained splice-pool pipes.
- Route standard-log library diagnostics through the configured logger, classify
  the benign SDK closed-writer message as debug, and retain unexpected errors.
- Add Linux, macOS, and Windows Go CI, Unix Spring AI acceptance, and a real-browser
  regression for cross-origin no-CORS requests.

## v0.1.3 - 2026-11-06

- Redirect the gateway root (`/`) to the interactive API documentation at `/docs`.
- Return HTTP 413 when trailing whitespace exceeds the 1 MiB request limit,
  including streamed request bodies.
- Return OpenAI-style HTTP 405 errors with an `Allow` header for unsupported
  methods on API endpoints; unknown paths retain HTTP 404 errors.
- Return HTTP 503 with `gateway_shutting_down` when shutdown interrupts model
  discovery, and stop the discovery CLI before the gateway exits.
- Log expected model-discovery capacity rejections and shutdown interruptions
  at informational level; retain error logs for CLI failures and timeouts.

## v0.1.2 - 2026-11-06

- Add an embedded Scalar interface at `/docs` for model discovery and buffered
  or streaming chat requests, including cancellation. UI assets load locally
  without a CDN, hosted request proxy, or API key.
- Serve the generated OpenAPI document at `/openapi.json`, with supported
  endpoints, request constraints, error responses, and examples for both harnesses.
- Display a terminal startup panel with version and build identity, API and
  documentation URLs, working directory, and request limits.
- Show enabled harnesses in a responsive table with installed CLI versions,
  configured default models, and resolved executable paths. Version probes run
  in parallel with bounded output and timeouts; failures allow startup.
- Add `--log-format json` and installed CLI versions in structured startup logs.
- Preserve cancellation during Copilot session cleanup so a disconnected request
  does not produce a misleading inference-failure log.
- Add browser acceptance tests for streaming, cancellation, process cleanup,
  capacity recovery, errors, custom ports, and mobile rendering. CI also validates
  the OpenAPI document and generated API types. Browser CI uses the pinned
  headless shell with bounded installation and test durations.

## v0.1.1

- Align repository, module, installation commands, and executable naming.
- Use double dashes for long CLI options and single-letter short aliases.

## v0.1.0

- Initial local OpenAI-compatible gateway for authenticated Codex and Copilot
  CLIs, with model discovery, buffered and streaming chat, reasoning effort,
  cancellation, and Spring AI integration.
